# DIABETES_PREDICTION_SQL_PROJECT-PSYLIQ-

Conducted a comprehensive analysis of a diabetes prediction dataset containing 100,000 rows and 11 columns.

Utilized MySQL queries to address 19 different questions related to patient demographics, medical history, and health outcomes.

Extracted insights on factors influencing diabetes risk, such as hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level.

Contributed to improving healthcare outcomes through data-driven insights and predictive analytics techniques.

Tool Used - MySQL

1. Retrieve the Patient_id and ages of all patients. 

2. Select all female patients who are older than 30. 

3. Calculate the average BMI of patients. 

4. List patients in descending order of blood glucose levels. 

5. Find patients who have hypertension and diabetes. 

6. Determine the number of patients with heart disease. 

7. Group patients by smoking history and count how many smokers and non- 
smokers there are. 

8. Retrieve the Patient_id of patients who have a BMI greater than the average BMI. 

9. Find the patient with the highest HbA1c level and the patient with the lowest 
HbA1clevel. 

10. Calculate the age of patients in years (assuming the current date as of now). 

11. Rank patients by blood glucose level within each gender group. 

12. Update the smoking history of patients who are older than 40 to "Ex-smoker." 

13. Insert a new patient into the database with sample data. 

14. Delete all patients with heart disease from the database. 

15. Find patients who have hypertension but not diabetes using the EXCEPT operator.

16. Define a unique constraint on the "patient_id" column to ensure its values are unique. 

17. Create a view that displays the Patient_ids, ages, and BMI of patients.
